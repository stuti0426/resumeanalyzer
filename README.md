I have created my virtual environment by running "python -m venv myenv" in the terminal and then activated it using "myenv/scripts/activate".
Then I installed all the necessary libraries which are given in requirements.txt file by running "install -r requirements.txt" on terminal.
Then the last step was to run "streamlit run app.py" on terminal. And we get our Resume analyzer.
